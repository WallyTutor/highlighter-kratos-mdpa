# Kratos Multiphysics MDPA Syntax Highlighter

Basic syntax highlighting for OpenCALPHAD macros created with [Yeoman generator tool](https://yeoman.io/).

## Installation instructions

Simply copy the directory [mdpa](mdpa/) to your VS Code extensions directory.

Under most Linux distributions this can be done with a simple:

```bash
cp -avr $(pwd)/mdpa/ ${HOME}/.vscode/extensions/

# or for development just link symbolically.
ln -s $(pwd)/mdpa/ ${HOME}/.vscode/extensions/
```

For Windows users, you should have a directory called `.vscode` in your user profile.
